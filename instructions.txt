IoT LockChain Project Setup and Run Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed on your system.

2. Create a project folder (e.g., iot-lockchain-final) and place all project files inside it: dashboard.py, kma_server.py, iot_device.py, requirements.txt, and the 'common' folder (with constants.py and crypto_utils.py inside).

3. Open a terminal/Command Prompt in the project folder and install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. (Optional) Delete devices_db.json if it exists to start with a clean database.

5. Run the KMA server in Terminal 1:
   python kma_server.py
   - You should see: "[SERVER] Running on port 8888 – READY"

6. Run the dashboard in Terminal 2:
   python dashboard.py
   - Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000
   - The page auto-refreshes every 4 seconds to show updates.

7. Register devices in Terminal 3 (and more terminals as needed):
   python iot_device.py
   - This registers 8 devices by default.
   - To register a custom number: python iot_device.py --num 10 (for 10 devices).
   - Run this script multiple times in separate terminals to add more devices (e.g., run twice for 16 devices total).
   - Keep these terminals open to maintain device connections (pings and data sending).

8. Interact with the dashboard:
   - View registered devices, status, heartbeats, and key versions.
   - Use "Force Rotation" button to manually rotate keys.
   - Revoke or Activate individual devices via buttons.
   - Keys auto-rotate every 20 seconds if active devices exist.

9. Troubleshooting:
   - If connections fail: Ensure port 8888 is consistent in iot_device.py and kma_server.py (change if needed).
   - View console outputs in terminals for logs (e.g., rotations, registrations).
